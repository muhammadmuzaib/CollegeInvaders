Meeting to change some specifications and refine others:
	- Decision to make the mechanics of the game as close to the original Space Invaders as possible
	- No player activated shield will be implemented - only the 4 barriers/shields in the original game
	- Must specify how much enemies move towards player and now frequently 
	- Extra life given at 1500 points 

Regarding Questions from Graphics team:
	- Enemy sprites will be human shaped - but "dressed up" differently to differentiate the amount of points an enemy is worth/class of enemy
		-IE: hat, or tie etc
	- SRS cannot specify which specific methods to use when it comes to player and enemy objects/sprites - but pixel art is a viable option
	- Projectiles player fires will be pencils 
	- Trustee explosion will include red blood color
	- Font size - location/background can be decided by graphics team 
	- UI design up to graphics

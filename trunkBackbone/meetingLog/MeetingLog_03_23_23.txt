Settled on using Phaser 3. The Phaser web work will work fine with Phaser 3. Talked about discussing player sprite 
images with the graphics team. Discussed how we will implement web works into the game. Agreed on posting a skeleton of the game to the branches folder by the end of the week. 

**Note**
Have a discussion with all the teams to clarify how the game will look, and what assets will be used.
